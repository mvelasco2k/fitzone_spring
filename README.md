FIT ZONE APP - SPRING FRAMEWORK

Developed in Java 22 CLI by Mateo Velasco

This app show a short menu to manage the clients to the Fit Zone Gym Into the option you can find:

List Clients
Find Client by Id
Create Client
Update Client
Delete Client
Close

This proyect use a connection with MySQL database to persist the data and different clients.
I used Spring Framework and another plugins like
  -  logback-spring
  -  MySQL connector
  -  Lombok

It's a little introducction to use Spring Framewrok in a simple application and manage the CRUD methods to persist a database
